- **Files Created**:
  - `scripts/lib/ui-theme-manager.js` (459 lines)
  - `scripts/lib/animation-controller.js` (569 lines)
  - `scripts/lib/keyboard-shortcuts.js` (487 lines)
  - `scripts/config/ui-config.js` (624 lines)

  - Implemented 15+ pre-built animations
  - Added 20+ keyboard shortcuts with context awareness
  - General UI configuration manager
- **Rationale**: Modernize UI/UX with accessibility and performance
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### Entry 3 ‚Äì Enhanced Core Script Integration
- **Date**: 2025-01-16
- **File**: `scripts/AutomateStash-Final-Enhanced.js` (1063 lines)
- **Changes**:
  - Integrated performance monitoring throughout
  - Added advanced caching to GraphQL client
  - Wrapped notifications with performance tracking
  - Created stub classes for missing automation logic
- **Rationale**: Create enhanced version with all optimizations
- **Status**: üöß 60% Complete (missing core automation methods)

### Current Gaps
- **Missing Methods** (13 critical):
  - `waitForElement`, `clickFast`, `detectScraperOutcome`
  - `checkAlreadyScraped`, `scrapeStashDB`, `scrapeThePornDB`
  - `findScrapeButton`, `findApplyButton`, `openEditPanel`
  - `applyScrapedData`, `createNewPerformers`
  - `organizeScene`, `saveScene`
- **Library Loading**: @require with file:// won't work for most users
- **Testing**: No performance benchmarks completed yet

### Performance Targets
- **Automation Time**: 40-50% reduction ‚è≥ (pending validation)
- **GraphQL Requests**: 40% reduction via caching ‚úÖ (infrastructure ready)
- **DOM Operations**: 60% reduction via batching ‚úÖ (infrastructure ready)
- **Memory Usage**: < 80MB sustained ‚úÖ (monitoring in place)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: > 70% ‚úÖ (LRU cache implemented)

## AutomateStash-Final.js (Original)

### Entry 1 ‚Äì Duplicate TTL cache + invalidation
- File: `scripts/AutomateStash-Final.js`
- Change: Added a 30s TTL cache to `GraphQLClient.findDuplicateScenes` keyed by `(distance, durationDiff)`; cleared cache after `sceneMerge` to ensure fresh results.
- Rationale: Reduce redundant server calls and UI re-render cost when toggling options repeatedly.
- Status: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Errors: None observed; linter clean.

### Entry 2 ‚Äì Debounced rendering with cancellation
- Change: Added render token (`_dupRenderCounter`) to cancel in-flight rendering when user refetches
- Rationale: Prevent UI overlap and jank when rapidly clicking fetch button
- Status: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Errors: None

### Next Steps (Enhanced Version)
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Copy missing automation methods from original
2. **HIGH**: Fix library loading mechanism (bundle or CDN)
3. **MEDIUM**: Run performance benchmarks and validate targets
4. **LOW**: Additional optimizations (virtualization, progressive enhancement)

## StashBulkOperations.js

### Entry 1 ‚Äì Enhanced GraphQL Client
- File: `scripts/StashBulkOperations.js`
- Changes:
  - Added configurable base URL and API key support
  - Implemented request timeout (30s default) with AbortController
  - Added automatic retry with exponential backoff (2 attempts by default)
  - Improved error handling with detailed logging
- Rationale: Make GraphQL client more robust and reusable
- Status: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Errors: None

### Entry 2 ‚Äì TaskQueue for Concurrency Control
- Changes:
  - Created TaskQueue class with configurable concurrency (default 4)
  - Added per-task timeout and retry logic
  - Implemented progress/error callbacks and abort functionality
- Rationale: Prevent overwhelming server with parallel requests, better error isolation
- Status: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Errors: None

### Entry 3 ‚Äì Batch Processing in BulkOperationsEngine
- Changes:
  - Added batch processing for operations exceeding 50 scenes
  - Integrated TaskQueue for controlled execution
  - Added pagination helper for fetching large datasets
  - Implemented scenesUpdate for batch mutations
- Rationale: Improve performance and reliability for large-scale operations
- Status: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Errors: None

### Entry 4 ‚Äì Enhanced Progress Tracker
- Changes:
  - Modern UI with gradient backgrounds and slide animations
  - Real-time ETA calculation based on processing rate
  - Error panel with detailed messages and timestamps
  - Auto-close for successful operations (3s delay)
  - Progress percentage displayed within progress bar
- Rationale: Better user feedback and error visibility
- Status: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Errors: None

### Entry 5 ‚Äì Preserve Selection After Operations
- Changes:
  - Removed automatic selection clearing after successful bulk operations
  - Added info message "Selection preserved for additional operations"
  - Users can still manually clear selection using the "Clear" button in toolbar
- Rationale: Allow users to perform multiple operations on the same set of scenes without reselecting
- Status: ‚úÖ Implemented
- Errors: None

### Next Steps
- Add saved presets for common bulk operations
- Implement dry-run mode for metadata changes
- Add batch undo functionality
