# Widget System Enhancements - Requirements Document

## Overview
This document defines requirements for comprehensive widget system enhancements including resizing capabilities, improved drag functionality, theme application fixes, keyboard shortcut improvements, animation positioning corrections, configuration integration, and z-index management for the Stash userscripts widget system.

## Identified Issues
1. Widgets are not resizable
2. Enhanced settings widget has broken dragging capabilities
3. Theme application is not working correctly
4. ESC key behavior is inconsistent (should close widgets/popups or cancel automation)
5. Most keyboard shortcuts are non-functional
6. Animation positioning is incorrect (animations start at bottom-right instead of widget position)
7. Configuration options from ui-config.js are not exposed in the UI
8. Widget z-index layering doesn't follow click-to-focus pattern

## Requirements

### 1. Widget Resizing Capabilities

#### REQ-1.1: Resizable Widget Implementation
**When** a widget is displayed in the Stash interface  
**Then** the widget shall provide resize handles on all corners and edges  
**And** the user shall be able to drag these handles to resize the widget  

#### REQ-1.2: Resize Constraints
**Given** a widget is being resized  
**When** the user drags a resize handle  
**Then** the widget shall enforce minimum dimensions of 200x150 pixels  
**And** the widget shall enforce maximum dimensions of 90% viewport width and height  

#### REQ-1.3: Resize Persistence
**Given** a widget has been resized  
**When** the widget is closed and reopened  
**Then** the widget shall restore to its previously resized dimensions  
**And** the size preference shall be stored in persistent storage  

### 2. Enhanced Settings Widget Dragging

#### REQ-2.1: Dragging Functionality Restoration
**Given** the enhanced settings widget is displayed  
**When** the user clicks and drags the widget header  
**Then** the widget shall move smoothly following the cursor  
**And** the drag operation shall not interfere with other widget interactions  

#### REQ-2.2: Drag Boundary Constraints
**Given** a widget is being dragged  
**When** the widget reaches viewport edges  
**Then** the widget shall be constrained within the visible viewport  
**And** at least 50 pixels of the widget header shall remain visible  

#### REQ-2.3: Drag State Management
**Given** a widget has been moved  
**When** the widget is closed and reopened  
**Then** the widget shall restore to its last position  
**And** the position shall be stored in persistent storage  

### 3. Theme Application System

#### REQ-3.1: Theme Application Fix
**When** a user selects a theme from the theme manager  
**Then** the theme shall be applied immediately to all active widgets  
**And** the theme shall persist across page reloads  

#### REQ-3.2: Dynamic Theme Switching
**Given** multiple widgets are open  
**When** the theme is changed  
**Then** all widgets shall update their appearance simultaneously  
**And** no visual artifacts or style conflicts shall occur  

#### REQ-3.3: Custom CSS Property Application
**Given** a theme defines CSS custom properties  
**When** the theme is applied  
**Then** all CSS custom properties shall be correctly set on widget root elements  
**And** child elements shall inherit the properties correctly  

### 4. ESC Key Behavior

#### REQ-4.1: ESC Key Context Detection
**When** the ESC key is pressed  
**Then** the system shall determine the current context (widget open, automation running, etc.)  
**And** execute the appropriate action based on context priority  

#### REQ-4.2: Widget Closure Priority
**Given** one or more widgets are open  
**When** the ESC key is pressed  
**Then** the topmost (highest z-index) widget shall be closed first  
**And** subsequent ESC presses shall close remaining widgets in z-order  

#### REQ-4.3: Automation Cancellation
**Given** automation is in progress and no modal widgets are open  
**When** the ESC key is pressed  
**Then** the automation shall be cancelled  
**And** a confirmation shall be shown if the automation is in a critical phase  

### 5. Keyboard Shortcuts

#### REQ-5.1: Keyboard Shortcut Registration
**When** the userscript loads  
**Then** all defined keyboard shortcuts shall be properly registered  
**And** shortcuts shall not conflict with browser or Stash native shortcuts  

#### REQ-5.2: Shortcut Functionality
**Given** keyboard shortcuts are defined in keyboard-shortcuts.js  
**When** a user presses a valid shortcut combination  
**Then** the associated action shall execute immediately  
**And** visual feedback shall confirm the action  

#### REQ-5.3: Context-Aware Shortcuts
**Given** different contexts exist (global, edit mode, automation)  
**When** a keyboard shortcut is pressed  
**Then** the system shall execute the context-appropriate action  
**And** ignore shortcuts not applicable to the current context  

### 6. Animation Positioning

#### REQ-6.1: Animation Origin Correction
**Given** a widget has animations enabled  
**When** an animation plays (open, close, minimize)  
**Then** the animation shall originate from the widget's actual position  
**And** not from a fixed screen position (bottom-right)  

#### REQ-6.2: Widget-Specific Animation Anchoring
**Given** the enhanced settings widget is centered on screen  
**When** opening or closing animations play  
**Then** animations shall use the widget's center point as the transform origin  
**And** scale/fade effects shall appear natural from that position  

#### REQ-6.3: Animation Coordinate System
**Given** widgets can be positioned anywhere on screen  
**When** animations are triggered  
**Then** the animation system shall calculate positions relative to the widget  
**And** use the widget's bounding box for animation transforms  

### 7. Configuration UI Integration

#### REQ-7.1: UI Config Options Exposure
**Given** configuration options exist in ui-config.js  
**When** the enhanced settings widget is opened  
**Then** all relevant UI configuration options shall be displayed  
**And** organized in logical sections (General, Notifications, Performance, etc.)  

#### REQ-7.2: Real-Time Configuration Updates
**Given** a user modifies a configuration option  
**When** the change is saved  
**Then** the change shall take effect immediately without page reload  
**And** all affected widgets shall update their behavior accordingly  

#### REQ-7.3: Configuration Validation
**Given** configuration options have defined constraints  
**When** a user enters a value  
**Then** the system shall validate the input against constraints  
**And** provide clear error messages for invalid values  

### 8. Z-Index Management (Click-to-Focus)

#### REQ-8.1: Click-to-Focus Implementation
**Given** multiple widgets are open  
**When** a user clicks on any part of a widget  
**Then** that widget shall become the topmost widget (highest z-index)  
**And** all other widgets shall maintain their relative z-order  

#### REQ-8.2: Z-Index Stack Management
**Given** widgets have z-index values  
**When** a widget is brought to front  
**Then** the system shall assign it the next highest z-index value  
**And** prevent z-index values from growing unbounded  

#### REQ-8.3: Focus Visual Indicators
**Given** a widget has focus (highest z-index)  
**When** displayed among multiple widgets  
**Then** the focused widget shall have a visual indicator (shadow, border, or opacity)  
**And** non-focused widgets shall appear slightly dimmed or de-emphasized  

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- Widget operations (resize, drag, focus) shall complete within 16ms (60 FPS)
- Theme switching shall complete within 100ms
- Keyboard shortcuts shall respond within 50ms

### NFR-2: Browser Compatibility
- All features shall work in Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
- Features shall be compatible with Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey

### NFR-3: Accessibility
- All widgets shall be keyboard navigable
- Focus indicators shall meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
- Screen reader announcements for state changes

### NFR-4: Storage Efficiency
- Widget state persistence shall use less than 100KB of storage
- Configuration shall be stored in a single consolidated object

## Dependencies
- ui-config.js configuration system
