# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Stash Collection Organizer is a userscript that provides intelligent organization suggestions, file naming standardization, metadata completeness analysis, and collection health monitoring for Stash libraries. This tool helps users maintain well-organized and consistent media collections.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want smart folder organization suggestions so that I can maintain a logical and consistent directory structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing my collection THEN the system SHALL suggest folder structures based on content patterns
2. WHEN organization suggestions are generated THEN the system SHALL consider performer, studio, and genre groupings
3. WHEN folder suggestions are provided THEN the system SHALL show before/after previews of the organization
4. WHEN implementing organization changes THEN the system SHALL update Stash file paths automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want file naming standardization so that I can maintain consistent naming conventions across my collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing file names THEN the system SHALL identify inconsistent naming patterns
2. WHEN standardization is applied THEN the system SHALL use configurable naming templates
3. WHEN renaming files THEN the system SHALL preserve original names as backup references
4. WHEN naming conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide resolution options and prevent overwrites

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want missing metadata detection so that I can identify and complete incomplete scene information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the collection THEN the system SHALL identify scenes with missing critical metadata
2. WHEN metadata gaps are found THEN the system SHALL prioritize missing information by importance
3. WHEN suggesting metadata completion THEN the system SHALL provide auto-fill options from available sources
4. WHEN metadata is incomplete THEN the system SHALL create actionable task lists for completion

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want collection health reports so that I can understand the overall state and quality of my media library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating health reports THEN the system SHALL analyze collection completeness and consistency
2. WHEN health issues are identified THEN the system SHALL categorize problems by severity and type
3. WHEN reports are complete THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for improvement
4. WHEN health monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL track collection health trends over time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want automated organization rules so that new content is organized consistently without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new content is added THEN the system SHALL automatically apply organization rules
2. WHEN organization rules are configured THEN the system SHALL allow custom logic based on metadata
3. WHEN automatic organization runs THEN the system SHALL respect user-defined exceptions and overrides
4. WHEN organization is applied THEN the system SHALL log all changes for review and potential rollback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want duplicate file detection so that I can identify and manage redundant content in my collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for duplicates THEN the system SHALL identify files with identical or similar content
2. WHEN duplicates are found THEN the system SHALL group them by similarity and provide comparison views
3. WHEN managing duplicates THEN the system SHALL suggest which files to keep based on quality metrics
4. WHEN duplicate resolution is performed THEN the system SHALL safely remove files while preserving metadata

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want collection statistics and insights so that I can understand my library composition and growth patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing collection statistics THEN the system SHALL show content distribution by various categories
2. WHEN analyzing collection growth THEN the system SHALL provide timeline charts and trend analysis
3. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL identify collection gaps and suggest content areas to explore
4. WHEN statistics are displayed THEN the system SHALL offer export options for external analysis
