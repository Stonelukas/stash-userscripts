# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Stash Export/Import Tools provide comprehensive data portability solutions for Stash users. This userscript enables exporting scene data to various formats, importing from other media managers, creating backups, and facilitating data migration between Stash instances.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to export my scene data to various formats so that I can use the data in external applications or create backups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting scene data THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats including JSON, CSV, XML, and custom formats
2. WHEN selecting export options THEN the system SHALL allow users to choose specific data fields and filtering criteria
3. WHEN exports are generated THEN the system SHALL include all related metadata such as performers, tags, and studios
4. WHEN large exports are processed THEN the system SHALL provide progress tracking and handle memory limitations efficiently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to import data from other media management systems so that I can migrate my existing collections to Stash.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL support common formats from popular media managers (Plex, Jellyfin, Kodi)
2. WHEN processing imports THEN the system SHALL map external data fields to Stash schema automatically
3. WHEN import conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide resolution options and prevent data loss
4. WHEN imports complete THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and provide import summary reports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to create comprehensive backups so that I can restore my Stash configuration and data if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating backups THEN the system SHALL include scene metadata, performer data, studio information, and user configurations
2. WHEN backup operations run THEN the system SHALL compress data efficiently and provide encryption options
3. WHEN scheduling backups THEN the system SHALL support automated backup creation with configurable frequency
4. WHEN backups are created THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity and provide restoration testing options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to restore data from backups so that I can recover from data loss or migrate to new installations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN restoring from backups THEN the system SHALL validate backup integrity before beginning restoration
2. WHEN restoration is performed THEN the system SHALL provide selective restore options for specific data types
3. WHEN restore conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL offer merge strategies and conflict resolution options
4. WHEN restoration completes THEN the system SHALL verify data consistency and provide restoration reports

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want data migration tools so that I can transfer data between different Stash instances efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating between instances THEN the system SHALL support both full and incremental data transfers
2. WHEN migration is configured THEN the system SHALL validate source and target compatibility
3. WHEN data transfer occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity and handle ID mapping
4. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL provide verification reports and rollback options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to synchronize data between multiple Stash instances so that I can maintain consistency across different installations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN synchronization is configured THEN the system SHALL identify differences between instances
2. WHEN sync conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution strategies based on timestamps and user preferences
3. WHEN synchronization runs THEN the system SHALL support bidirectional sync with change tracking
4. WHEN sync operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide detailed sync reports and change logs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to export specific collections or filtered data so that I can share curated datasets or create targeted backups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating filtered exports THEN the system SHALL support complex filtering criteria including tags, performers, studios, and date ranges
2. WHEN exporting collections THEN the system SHALL maintain relationships between exported entities
3. WHEN sharing exports THEN the system SHALL provide privacy options to exclude sensitive metadata
4. WHEN processing filtered exports THEN the system SHALL optimize export size and processing time
