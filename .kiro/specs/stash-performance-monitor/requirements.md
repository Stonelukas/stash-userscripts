# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Stash Performance Monitor is a userscript that provides comprehensive performance monitoring, database optimization analysis, scan progress tracking, and system resource monitoring for Stash installations. This tool helps users identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their Stash experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to monitor database performance metrics so that I can identify and resolve performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring database performance THEN the system SHALL track query execution times and identify slow queries
2. WHEN database metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL monitor database size, index usage, and connection statistics
3. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for optimization
4. WHEN database analysis runs THEN the system SHALL generate performance reports with actionable insights

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to track scan progress and performance so that I can optimize my scanning workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scans are running THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress with estimated completion times
2. WHEN scan performance is monitored THEN the system SHALL track files processed per minute and identify bottlenecks
3. WHEN scans complete THEN the system SHALL provide detailed scan statistics and performance analysis
4. WHEN multiple scans are compared THEN the system SHALL show performance trends and improvements over time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to monitor system resource usage so that I can ensure optimal hardware utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring resources THEN the system SHALL track CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O
2. WHEN resource limits are approached THEN the system SHALL provide warnings and optimization suggestions
3. WHEN resource usage is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify peak usage periods and resource-intensive operations
4. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL correlate resource usage with specific Stash operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want performance optimization suggestions so that I can improve my Stash installation's efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance analysis completes THEN the system SHALL provide specific optimization recommendations
2. WHEN optimization suggestions are given THEN the system SHALL prioritize recommendations by potential impact
3. WHEN implementing optimizations THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guidance and validation
4. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN the system SHALL measure and report performance improvements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want historical performance tracking so that I can understand performance trends and the impact of changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN collecting performance data THEN the system SHALL store historical metrics for trend analysis
2. WHEN viewing performance history THEN the system SHALL display charts showing performance trends over time
3. WHEN performance changes occur THEN the system SHALL correlate changes with system modifications or updates
4. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL predict future performance issues and resource needs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want automated performance alerts so that I can be notified of performance issues before they impact my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL send configurable alerts and notifications
2. WHEN setting up alerts THEN the system SHALL allow customizable thresholds for different performance metrics
3. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL provide context about the issue and suggested actions
4. WHEN alert conditions are resolved THEN the system SHALL send confirmation notifications

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want performance benchmarking so that I can compare my installation's performance with optimal configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running benchmarks THEN the system SHALL test database operations, file scanning, and UI responsiveness
2. WHEN benchmarks complete THEN the system SHALL compare results with baseline performance metrics
3. WHEN performance gaps are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest specific improvements to reach optimal performance
4. WHEN benchmarks are repeated THEN the system SHALL track performance improvements over time
