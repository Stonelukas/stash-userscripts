# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Stash Scene Quality Analyzer is a userscript that automatically analyzes video quality metrics, identifies potential issues, and provides recommendations for content organization. This tool helps users maintain a high-quality media library by detecting low-resolution content, duplicates, and other quality concerns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to automatically analyze video quality metrics so that I can identify low-quality content in my library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analyzer runs on a scene THEN the system SHALL extract video resolution, bitrate, and codec information
2. WHEN quality metrics are analyzed THEN the system SHALL assign a quality score based on resolution and bitrate
3. WHEN quality analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display quality indicators on scene cards
4. WHEN quality data is available THEN the system SHALL store quality metrics for future reference

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to identify duplicate scenes so that I can clean up my library and save storage space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analyzer processes scenes THEN the system SHALL generate content fingerprints for duplicate detection
2. WHEN potential duplicates are found THEN the system SHALL group similar scenes together
3. WHEN duplicate groups are created THEN the system SHALL rank scenes by quality within each group
4. WHEN duplicates are identified THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for which files to keep or remove

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to flag scenes with quality issues so that I can prioritize them for replacement or enhancement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scenes have resolution below 720p THEN the system SHALL flag them as "Low Resolution"
2. WHEN scenes have very low bitrates THEN the system SHALL flag them as "Low Bitrate"
3. WHEN scenes have audio issues THEN the system SHALL flag them as "Audio Problems"
4. WHEN quality flags are assigned THEN the system SHALL create filterable tags for easy identification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to generate quality reports so that I can understand the overall health of my media library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a quality report THEN the system SHALL analyze all scenes in the library
2. WHEN the report is complete THEN the system SHALL show distribution of quality scores
3. WHEN quality issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide statistics on different problem types
4. WHEN the report is generated THEN the system SHALL offer export options for external analysis

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want quality analysis to run automatically so that new content is analyzed without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new scenes are added to Stash THEN the system SHALL automatically queue them for quality analysis
2. WHEN the analyzer detects new content THEN the system SHALL process it in the background
3. WHEN automatic analysis is enabled THEN the system SHALL respect user-defined processing schedules
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL update scene metadata with quality information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want to customize quality thresholds so that I can define what constitutes acceptable quality for my library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring quality settings THEN the system SHALL allow users to set minimum resolution thresholds
2. WHEN setting quality criteria THEN the system SHALL allow users to define minimum bitrate requirements
3. WHEN quality thresholds are changed THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate existing quality scores
4. WHEN custom thresholds are applied THEN the system SHALL update quality flags accordingly
