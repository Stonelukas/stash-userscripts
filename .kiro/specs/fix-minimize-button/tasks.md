# Implementation Plan

## Status: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**Implementation Approach:** Clean rewrite with simplified architecture in AutomateStash-Clean.js

- [x] 1. Fix duplicate UIManager instantiation and improve constructor
  - **COMPLETED**: Clean UIManager class with proper constructor and no duplicate instantiation
  - Implemented single UIManager instance with proper initialization
  - Added proper method binding and state management (isMinimized, panel, minimizedButton)
  - Clean constructor with proper property initialization
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [x] 2. Create robust event handler wrapper system
  - **COMPLETED**: Simplified but robust event handling approach
  - Direct event handler binding with proper context preservation
  - Implemented minimize button click handler with proper `this` binding
  - Added error handling through try-catch blocks in automation methods
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Implement centralized state management system
  - **COMPLETED**: Simple but effective state management
  - UIManager maintains state through instance properties (isMinimized, panel, minimizedButton)
  - State synchronization through direct property access
  - Proper cleanup and state reset in cleanup() method
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Fix minimize button creation in full panel
  - **COMPLETED**: Working minimize button in createHeader() method
  - Minimize button properly created with event listener
  - Correct context binding using arrow function and proper `this` reference
  - Validation through element existence checks before manipulation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 5. Enhance minimized button creation and click handling
  - **COMPLETED**: Functional createMinimizedButton() method
  - Proper cleanup of existing minimized button before creating new one
  - Working expand functionality with proper panel restoration
  - Context binding preserved through proper method calls
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 2.3_

- [x] 6. Improve minimizePanel method implementation
  - **COMPLETED**: Clean minimizePanel() method
  - Proper state updates (this.isMinimized = true)
  - DOM cleanup by hiding panel and creating minimized button
  - Element tracking through instance properties
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 3.3_

- [x] 7. Create comprehensive debug logging system
  - **COMPLETED**: Console logging with emoji prefixes throughout
  - Structured logging for all major operations (üì±, üîç, üíæ, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå)
  - Context logging in automation methods and UI operations
  - Status updates through updateSceneStatus() method
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 8. Add fallback mechanisms and error recovery
  - **COMPLETED**: Error handling and recovery mechanisms
  - Try-catch blocks in all async operations
  - Timeout protection through waitForElement with timeout parameter
  - Graceful error handling with user notifications
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 4.3_

- [x] 9. Update DOM cleanup and element management
  - **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive cleanup() method
  - Proper element existence checks before DOM manipulation
  - Consistent element removal patterns (remove existing before creating new)
  - Memory leak prevention through proper cleanup
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 1.4_

- [x] 10. Test and validate minimize button functionality
  - **COMPLETED**: Functional minimize/expand cycle
  - Working minimize button that hides panel and creates minimized button
  - Working expand functionality that restores full panel
  - Proper state management throughout minimize/expand operations
  - Performance optimized with direct DOM manipulation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2_

## Additional Completed Features
- [x] **Complete automation workflow**: checkAlreadyScraped(), applyScrapedData(), saveScene()
- [x] **Skip already scraped logic**: Intelligent detection of previously scraped sources
- [x] **Notification system**: NotificationManager with visual feedback
- [x] **Configuration management**: Persistent settings with GM_setValue/GM_getValue
- [x] **Error handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks and user feedback
