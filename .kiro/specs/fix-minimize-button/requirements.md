# Requirements Document

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

All requirements have been successfully implemented in AutomateStash-Clean.js with a simplified but effective approach.

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical bug where the minimize button in the AutomateStash widget is not functioning properly. The minimize button should allow users to collapse the full automation panel into a compact minimized state, but currently fails to respond to user clicks or execute the minimization logic correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a Stash user running AutomateStash, I want the minimize button to work reliably so that I can collapse the automation panel when I don't need the full interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ WHEN the user clicks the minimize button in the full automation panel THEN the system SHALL hide the full panel and display a minimized button
2. ✅ WHEN the minimize button is clicked THEN the system SHALL preserve the current automation state without interrupting any running processes
3. ✅ WHEN the panel is minimized THEN the system SHALL maintain all configuration settings and automation progress
4. ✅ WHEN the minimize action completes THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the action was successful

**Implementation:** Working minimize button in `createHeader()` method with proper state management and visual feedback.

### Requirement 2 ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want the minimize button to be properly bound to the correct context so that it executes the intended functionality without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ WHEN the minimize button is created THEN the system SHALL properly bind the click event handler to the UIManager context
2. ✅ WHEN the minimize button is clicked THEN the system SHALL execute the minimize function without throwing JavaScript errors
3. ✅ IF the UIManager context is not available THEN the system SHALL use a fallback mechanism to ensure minimize functionality works
4. ✅ WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL log clear debug information about the minimize button's context binding

**Implementation:** Arrow function event handlers ensure proper `this` context binding with comprehensive error handling and logging.

### Requirement 3 ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a Stash user, I want the minimize/expand cycle to work consistently so that I can toggle between full and minimized views multiple times without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ WHEN the user expands from minimized state THEN the system SHALL restore the full panel with all previous settings intact
2. ✅ WHEN the user minimizes and expands multiple times THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent behavior without degradation
3. ✅ WHEN the panel state changes THEN the system SHALL properly clean up previous UI elements to prevent conflicts
4. ✅ WHEN the user manually expands the panel THEN the system SHALL respect the user's preference and disable auto-minimization

**Implementation:** Functional `createMinimizedButton()` and `cleanup()` methods ensure proper state management and element lifecycle.

### Requirement 4 ✅ COMPLETED

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the AutomateStash script, I want comprehensive logging for the minimize button functionality so that I can identify and resolve context binding issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ WHEN the minimize button is created THEN the system SHALL log the creation process and context binding status
2. ✅ WHEN the minimize button is clicked THEN the system SHALL log the click event and execution path
3. ✅ WHEN minimize functionality fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including context availability
4. ✅ WHEN fallback mechanisms are triggered THEN the system SHALL log which fallback was used and why

**Implementation:** Comprehensive emoji-prefixed console logging throughout all operations with structured debug information and error handling.
